# Hand-Gesture 2048 Android Game

Welcome! Here, you will find the Android Studio Project for a revamped version of the popular "2048" game. The original 2048 game is played by swiping the screen in any direction (e.g. left) to move the nummerical blocks. However, this revamped version uses the hand-gestures of the user to determine the movement of the blocks. For example, if the user shakes their phone
to the right, the sensors inside the phone detect this and all blocks move to the right to occupy empty cells.

If you would like to **try out the app, download the APK from the root (app-debug.apk) on your Android phone**. 
For instructions on how to do this from your PC, please refer to: [Install-apk-files-on-android](https://airmore.com/install-apk-files-on-android.html). **It's easier to download it directly from your smartphone** through GitHub's desktop site however. The app is installed as "Lab4_204_06".

This app is **optimized for _2560+_ x _1440+_ display so please ensure your screen resolution is set accordingly** before testing it.

The app was developed from the ground up throughout the University of Waterloo's programming labs as a part of the embedded systems course which covered the fundamentals of Java development on Android Studio and the implementation of event handlers according to multiple sensors on an Android smartphone. **The source code for the game loop and main game logic is found under: /app/src/main/java/lab4_204_06/uwaterloo/ca/lab4_204_06/**

The team I collaborated with to develop this prototype were two of my class mates in Computer Engineering at Waterloo:
- s3@edu.uwaterloo.ca : Steven Steven
- sfxu@edu.uwaterloo.ca : Steven Xu

We used **SubVersion for version control** and source code management at the time of developing the project.
