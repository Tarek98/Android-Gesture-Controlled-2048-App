# Hand-Gesture 2048 Android Game

Welcome,

This repository holds the Android Studio Project for a revamped version of the popular "2048" game. The original 2048 game is
played by swiping the screen left,right,up, or down (in any direction) to move the nummerical blocks. However, this revamped
version uses the hand-gestures of the user to determine the movement of the blocks. For example, if the user shakes their phone
to the right, the sensors inside the phone detect this and all blocks move to the right to occupy empty cells.

The app was developed from the ground up throughout the University of Waterloo's programming labs as a part of the embedded systems course which covered the fundamentals of Java development on Android Studio and the implementation of event handlers according to multiple sensors on an Android smartphone.

If you would like to try out the app, download the APK from the root (app-debug.apk) on your Android phone. 
For more instructions on how to do this from your PC, please refer to: [Install-apk-files-on-android](https://airmore.com/install-apk-files-on-android.html). It's easier to download it directly from your smartphone however

The team I collaborated with to develop this prototype were two of my class mates in Computer Engineering at Waterloo:
- s3@edu.uwaterloo.ca : Steven Steven
- sfxu@edu.uwaterloo.ca : Steven Xu
We used Subversion for version control and source code management at the time of developing the project.

This app is optimized for 2560+ x 1440+ display so please ensure your screen resolution is set accordingly before testing it out.
